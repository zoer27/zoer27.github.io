title: Population dynamics of baleen whales using whaling data
subtitle: Baleen whales were heavily exploited during commercial whaling in the 20th century. Extensive biological data was collected during this exploitation. My work uses contemporary quantitative methods to analyze this historical data to answer long-standing questions about baleen whale populations.

I use Bayesian models that integrate abundance data to estimate inter-season movement rates among the three ocean basins in the Southern Ocean (Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific), finding high probabilities of inter-season movement in almost all directions. These high rates of movement suggest that there is little evidence for population structure arising from geographic separation between Antarctic blue whales in the Southern Ocean.

We found the opposite trend that had been predicted for ungulates, that longer mothers had more female calves. This suggests that being big is important for baleen whale mothers to survive the costs of reproducing.

Baird (CC)) </span> |  <span style="font-size:20px"> **What is the current status of Antarctic blue whales?** </span> <br> The Antarctic blue whale is the largest of all blue whale subspecies and, before whaling, the most numerous, accounting for 90% of pre-whaling blue whale abundance. In 2004, it was found that that their population size was increasing, though still at less than 1% of their pre-whaling abundance. In this study, I use Bayesian methods to integrate multiple historical and contemporary datasets to estimate the population size and growth rate of Antarctic blue whales.

Using this data, I will fit models to understand the age-length relationship for blue whales, as well as estimate natural survival and age at sexual maturity. These results will provide valuable information that can be used for evaluating extinction risk and population recovery for blue whales.|
