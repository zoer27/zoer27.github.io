title: Ecological indicators for non-stationary time series
subtitle: Using Hidden Markov models I demonstrate a method for analyzing ecological indicators in the presence of regime shifts using sea surface temperature and seabird density as case studies.

Ecological indicators are widely used to synthesize information for scientists, managers, stakeholders and the public. Model-based approaches can advance the value of the ecosystem indicators. Models provide a more objective way to select indicators that represent a diverse range of responses to ecosystem processes, as well as to identify indicators that may be redundant due to providing similar information. I develop a model-based approach to analyze and select ecological indicators in the face of changing conditions over time. I use case studies from sea surface temperature and seabird density to illustrate these ideas. This work was completed in collaboration with researchers at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA).
