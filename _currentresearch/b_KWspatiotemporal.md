title: Changes in Killer whale presence in Washington waters
subtitle: The Washington portion of the Salish Sea contains both Southern resident killer whales as well as transient killer whales. I use a decades-long database of killer whale detections to analyse how killer whale presence has changed in the region over time.

The two ecotypes of killer whales in Washington waters of the Salish Sea—Southern residents and transients—overlap in space but respond to different ecological process and face different threats. Using detections of both ecotypes from 1978-2022 I fit spatiotemporal models to understand how killer whale presence has changed in the region in space and time. This paper is currently in preparation. The project was completed in collaboration with researchers at the West Coast Regional Office and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) as well as The Whale Museum. It was supported by funding from the Puget Sound Partnership.
