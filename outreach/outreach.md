## Outreach

### Mentor in the Identity Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS) program

As a mentor with [IBIS,](https://environment.uw.edu/students/current-students/identity-belonging-and-inquiry-in-science-ibis-program/) I was paired with an undergraduate marine biology student and together we designed and implemented a research project estimating growth rates of Antarctic blue whale offspring using fetal data from whaling. As part of this program I also participated in mentorship training and professional development workshops.

### Students Explore Aquatic Sciences (SEAS) member and board member

As a member of [SEAS](https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/) I have visited elementary school classrooms to teach lessons about salmon ecology and killer whales. I have also developed activities to teach the general public about quantitative ecology at our Open House event. As a board member (2021-2022) I developed relationships with elementary schools and connected teachers and graduate students.

## Invited Seminars

Movement rates of Antarctic blue whales from historical data using Bayesian models. SAFS Quantitative Seminar, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. October 21, 2022.

Bayesian models reveal endangered Antarctic blue whale population is increasing but still far from pre-whaling levels. SAFS Quantitative Seminar, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. February 21, 2025.

## Guest Lectures

### Beautiful Graphics in R

Fall 2024: Covered basic plotting techniques using ggplot in R.

### Conservation and Management of Aquatic Resources

Winter 2025: Covered history of whaling and the development of the International Whaling Commission and it's management strategy.

### Evolutionary Ecology of Marine Mammals

Spring 2024: Lecture and hands-on activity exploring adaptive sex ratio behavior in marine mammals.

Spring 2025: Lecture covered history of whaling, the population and ecosystem level impacts of whaling and the history of whale conservation. Also developed a [hands-on lab activity](https://zoer27.github.io/FISH-497-Marine-Mammal-Abundance/) to explore methods for estimating marine mammal abundance in R.
