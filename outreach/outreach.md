## Outreach
### Mentor in the Identity Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS) program
As a mentor with [IBIS,](https://environment.uw.edu/students/current-students/identity-belonging-and-inquiry-in-science-ibis-program/) I was paired with an undergraduate marine biology student and together we designed and implemented a research project estimating growth rates of Antarctic blue whale offspring using fetal data from whaling. As part of this program I also participated in mentorship training and professional development workshops.

### Students Explore Aquatic Sciences (SEAS) member and board member
As a member of [SEAS](https://fish.uw.edu/students/student-organizations/students-explore-aquatic-sciences-seas/) I have visited elementary school classrooms to teach lessons about salmon ecology and killer whales. I have also developed activities to teach the general public about quantitative ecology at our Open House event. As a board member (2021-2022) I developed relationships with elementary schools and connected teachers and graduate students.
